  <h3>Coding</h3>
  <p>I had never written a single line of meaningful code before coming to IITB (okay, let's face it, HTML and LOGO aren't programming languages). Now I can code in many languages, and I even have a blog and YouTube channel for programming. </p>

<h3>Music</h3>
<p> I had been interested in music ever since childhood. I used to play the piano, and currently I play the Guitar. I also use a loop station to cover Ed Sheeran, who is also my favourite artist. I also like Linkin Park, Coldplay, Eminem and a few Hindi songs.</p>

<h3>Writing</h3>
<p>I am an active writer on Quora and my Blog. Most of my writing evolves around JEE preparations, Computer Science, Competitve exams, and my life.</p>
<h3>Reading</h3>
<p>
I have recently developed a taste for reading. I have read two books called "Think and Grow Rich" and "Zero to One". I really liked them, and I am currently reading Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone. I also enjoy reading standard academic books.
</p></div>
<div id="Paris" class="tabcontent">
 
  <p>I am a startup enthusiast. I am currently working on something, but its in a very initial stage. Let's see where do I reach. I also have some short term goals, like becoming better at coding, knowing more about myself, etc.</p> 
</div>

<div id="Tokyo" class="tabcontent">
  
  <p>My amibition in life to become a great human being. I want to help and reach out to as many people as possible, and want to make a difference in the world as we see it today.</p>

			   <h2>Web Designer</h2>
			   <p>
			   Hi! I am Bhavesh Haswani. I'm studying in 3rd year Computer Engineering at Watumull College.
			   I've created this website for my Experiment. I've recently developed interest in Web Designing.
			   Now I can develop websites and use my coding skills to get a better job.

									<h4>Learning New Things</h4>
								</li>
								<p>I like to learn new things by my own as internet is a huge library.
									My passion is to learn and earn by using the Internet and a Computer.
									The greatest part of working with a computer is being able to bring an idea into life.

									<h4>Reading Books</h4>
								</li>
								<p>
									Books are made for refreshment as well as for knowledge purposes.
									So I love to read books about nature and environment and animals as well.

									<h4>Sketching</h4>
								</li>
								<p>
									I love sketching. Sketching and drawing is a great way to improve your creative skills and 	start thinking in a different way. Art shows you that there is normally more than one way to solve a problem. Art encourages open ended thinking and creativity. These can be really helpful for personal development and solving problems.
